// Package remoterelations defines workers which manage the operation of cross
// model relations.
//
//   - `Worker`: Top level worker. Watches remote applications/proxies and
//     creates a worker for each.
//   - `remoteApplicationWorker`: Manages operations for a consumer or offer
//     proxy. Consumes and publishes relation data and status changes.
//   - `remoteRelationsWorker`: Runs on the consuming model to manage relations
//     to the offer.
//   - `relationUnitsWorker`: Runs on the consuming model to receive and
//     publish changes to each relation unit data bag.
//
// The consuming side pushes relation updates from the consumer application to
// the model containing the offer. It also polls the offered application to
// record relation changes from the offer into the consuming model.
