// Package block provides the ability to block certain operations on a model.
// This is useful when you want to prevent accidental changes to a model.
// The operations that can be blocked are grouped into logical sets, and
// each set can be enabled or disabled independently.
//
// Commands that interact with the model should check if the operation they
// performed is blocked. A user friendly client message explaining the block
// should be provided to the user from the API server.
// Tests should be written to ensure that the correct operations are blocked
// when the block is enabled.
