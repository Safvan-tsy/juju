# This script recursively finds all .excalidraw files in the current directory
# and converts them to SVG format using the excalidraw-brute-export-cli tool.
# It requires Node.js and the Playwright library to be installed.
#
# Note: The playwright installation is a little heavy, so it might take some time. But it is necessary for the
#       excalidraw-brute-export-cli to work. This the only way to export excalidraw files to SVG, saving the fonts and
#       other assets in the SVG file, all other tools do not provide this feature.
