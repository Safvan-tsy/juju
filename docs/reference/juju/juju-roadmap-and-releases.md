# Juju Roadmap & Releases

> See also: {ref}`upgrade-your-deployment`

This document is about our releases of Juju, that is, the `juju` CLI client and the Juju agents.

- We release new minor version (the 'x' of m.x.p) approcimately every 3 months.
- Patch releases for supported series are released every month
- Once we release a new major version, the latest minor version of the previous release will become an LTS (Long Term Support) release.

- Minor releases are supported with bug fixes for a period of 6 months from their release date, and a further 3 months of security fixes. LTS releases will receive security fixes for 5 years.

- 4.0 is an exception to the rule, as it is still under development. We plan on releasing beta versions that are content driven and not time.

The rest of this document gives detailed information about each release.

### üî∏ **Juju 2.9.13** - Release cancelled, replaced by 2.9.14

This release adds support for pulling images used for CAAS models from private OCI registries! This means you can host your own `jujud-operator`, `charm-base` and `juju-db` images. This initial release focuses on private registries on Dockerhub, with other public cloud registry support coming in a future release. More details in [this post](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/initial-private-registry-support/5079).

üõ†Ô∏è Fixes:

### üî∏ **Juju 2.9.9** - 19 Jul 2021

üõ†Ô∏è Fixes:

- Juju 2.9.8 tries to use an empty UID when deleting Kubernetes objects, and cannot remove applications ([LP](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1936262))
- The `juju-log` output going to machine log file instead of unit log file in Juju 2.9.5 ([LP](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1933548))

See the full list in the [milestone page](https://launchpad.net/juju/+milestone/2.9.9).

### üî∏ **Juju 2.9.8** - 13 Jul 2021

This release introduces support for bootstrapping and deploying workloads to **[Equinix](https://www.equinix.com) cloud**. To try out the new provider:

- Run `juju update-public-clouds --client` to ensure that provider API endpoint list is up to date.
- Add a credential for the equinix cloud (`juju add-credential equinix`). You will need to specify your equinix project ID and provide an API key. You can use the equinix [console](https://console.equinix.com) to look up your project ID and generate API tokens.
- Select a metro area and bootstrap a new controller. For example to bootstrap to the Amsterdam data-center you may run the following command: `juju bootstrap equinix/am`.

Caveats:

- Due to substrate limitations, the equinix provider does not implement support for firewalls. As a result, workloads deployed to machines under the same project ID can reach each other even across Juju models.
- Deployed machines are always assigned both a public and a private IP address. This means that any deployed charms are _implicitly exposed_ and proper access control mechanisms need to be implemented to prevent unauthorized access to the deployed workloads.

This release also introduces **logging labels** which will help with the aggregation of logs via a label rather than a namespace.

```
juju model-config "logging-config='#http=TRACE'"
```

The above will turn on HTTP loggers to trace. This is a new UX feature to help with debugging, it's not been full worked through Juju yet and might be subject to change.

üõ†Ô∏è Fixes:

- Juju fails to deploy mysql-k8s charm with its image resource ([LP](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1934416))
- Juju 2.9 failing to create ClusterRoleBinding ([LP](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1934180))
- Juju interprets `caas-image-repo` containing port number incorrectly ([LP](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1934707))

### üî∏ **Juju 2.9.7** - 06 Jul 2021

üõ†Ô∏è Fixes:

- Juju upgrade 2.9 controller from local branch fails with wrong namespace. ([LP](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1930798))
- Unit network data not populated on peer relations in sidecar charms ([LP](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1922133))

- The `juju ssh --proxy` command is not working on aws when targeting containers with FAN addresses ([LP](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1932547))
- The `juju resources` revision date format uses year-date-month format instead of year-month-date ([LP](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1933705))
- Using `juju config` with empty values erroneously resets since 2.9 ([LP](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1934151))
