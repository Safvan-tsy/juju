## Examples

Debug all hooks and actions of unit `mysql/0`:

    juju debug-code mysql/0

Debug all hooks and actions of the `mysql/leader` unit:

    juju debug-code mysql/leader

Debug the `config-changed` hook of unit '1':

    juju debug-code mysql/1 config-changed

Debug the `pull-site action` and `update-status` hook of the `hello-kubecon` charm:

    juju debug-code hello-kubecon/0 pull-site update-status

Debug the `leader-elected` hook and set `JUJU_DEBUG_AT` variable to `hook`:

    juju debug-code --at=hook mysql/0 leader-elected


## Details

The command launches a `tmux` session that will intercept matching hooks and/or
actions.

Initially, the `tmux` session will take you to `/var/lib/juju` or `/home/ubuntu`.
As soon as a matching hook or action is fired, the hook or action is executed
and the `JUJU_DEBUG_AT` variable is set. Charms implementing support for this
should set debug breakpoints based on the environment variable. Charms written
with the Ops library automatically provide support for this.

Valid unit identifiers are:
- a standard unit ID, such as `mysql/0` or;
- leader syntax of the form `<application>/leader`, such as `mysql/leader`.

If no hook or action is specified, all hooks and actions will be intercepted.

See `juju help ssh` for information about SSH related options
accepted by the `debug-code` command.
