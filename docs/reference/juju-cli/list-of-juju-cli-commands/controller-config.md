## Summary
Displays or sets configuration settings for a controller.

## Usage
```juju controller-config [options] [<attribute key>[=<value>] ...]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `-c`, `--controller` |  | Controller to operate in |
| `--color` | false | Use ANSI color codes in output |
| `--file` |  | Path to yaml-formatted configuration file |
| `--format` | tabular | Specify output format (json&#x7c;tabular&#x7c;yaml) |
| `--ignore-read-only-fields` | false | Ignore read-only fields that might cause errors to be emitted while processing yaml documents |
| `--no-color` | false | Disable ANSI color codes in tabular output |
| `-o`, `--output` |  | Specify an output file |

## Examples


To view the value of a single config key for the current controller:

    juju controller-config <key>

To view the value of all config keys for the current controller in the json format:

    juju controller-config --format json

To view the values of all config keys for a different controller:

    juju controller-config -c <controller>

To set two keys in the current controller to a different value:

    juju controller-config <key>=<value> <key>=<value>

To save a controller's current config to a yaml file:

    juju controller-config --format=yaml > cfg.yaml

To set the current controller's config from a yaml file ignoring read-only fields,
then override the value for one key:

    juju controller-config --file path/to/file.yaml --ignore-read-only-fields <key>=<value>

To view all the configs from one file in yaml, then apply the same config values
to another controller from stdin using `|` and `-` (in `--file=-`):

    juju controller-config -c <controller> --format=yaml \
      | juju controller-config -c <controller> --file=- --ignore-read-only-fields
