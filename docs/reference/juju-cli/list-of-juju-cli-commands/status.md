Report the status of the `mysql` application:

    juju status mysql

Report the status for applications that start with `nova-`:

    juju status nova-*

Include information about storage and relations in output:

    juju status --storage --relations

Provide output as valid `JSON`:

    juju status --format=json

    juju status error


## Details

Report the model's status, optionally filtered by names of applications or
units. When selectors are present, filter the report to exclude entities that
do not match.

    juju status [<selector> [...]]

`<selector>` selects machines, units or applications from the model to display.
Wildcard characters (`*`) enable multiple entities to be matched at the same
time.

    (<machine>|<unit>|<application>)[*]

When an entity that matches &lt;selector&gt; is integrated with other applications, the
status of those applications will also be presented. By default (without a
`<selector>`) the status of all applications and their units will be displayed.


### Altering the output format

The `--format` option allows you to specify how the status report is formatted.

- `--format=tabular` (default):
Displays information about all aspects of the model in a human-centric manner.
Omits some information by default.
Use the `--relations` and `--storage` options to include all available information.
- `--format=line`, `--format=short`, `--format=oneline `:
Reports information from units. Includes their IP address, open ports and the status of the workload and agent.
- `--format=summary`:
Reports aggregated information about the model. Includes a description of subnets and ports that are in use,
the counts of applications, units, and machines by status code.
- `--format=json`, `--format=yaml`:
Provides information in a `JSON` or `YAML` format for programmatic use.
