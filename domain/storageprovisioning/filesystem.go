// with a filesystem attachment. In this case the id refers to the filesystem
// resource the attachment is for. As well as this the name of the machine and
// or the unit the attachment is for is also provided.
//
// As it is unclear if a filesystem attachment is for a unit or a machine either
// one of the name values will be set but not both.
